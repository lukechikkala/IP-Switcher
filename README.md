# IP-Switcher
Quick tool that switches the selected interface's IP Address from a bunch of static addresses to DHCP or vice versa.<br>

There are four versions of the tool:<br>
* [Win 10 Commandline Version](https://github.com/lukechikkala/IP-Switcher/tree/master/Win10_C%2B%2B)
* [Win 10 Batch Script](https://github.com/lukechikkala/IP-Switcher/blob/master/Win10_Batch_File/IP%20Switcher.bat)
* [GUI - gtkmm Version](https://github.com/lukechikkala/IP-Switcher/tree/master/GUI)
* [GUI - ImGui Version](https://github.com/lukechikkala/IP-Switcher/tree/master/ImGui)

The tools currently assigns the following Static IP Addresses:<br>
* `192.168.1.77` - This will be the primary IP Address.<br>
* `2.168.1.77`<br>
* `10.168.1.77`<br>
* `192.168.3.77`<br>
* `192.168.100.77`<br>
