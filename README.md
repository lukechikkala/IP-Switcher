# IP-Switcher
Quick tool that switches the said interface's IP Address from a bunch of static addresses to DHCP or vice versa.<br>
At the moment, the tool only interacts with a network interface named "Ethernet 2"<br>
Once the core structured is implemented, I will implement a way to select the network interface.

There are two versions of the tool:<br>
* [Commandline Utility](https://github.com/lukechikkala/IP-Switcher/blob/master/Win10_Batch_File/IP%20Switcher.bat)
* [GUI](https://github.com/lukechikkala/IP-Switcher/tree/master/GUI)

The tools assigns the following Static IP Addresses:<br>
* `192.168.1.77` - This will be the primary IP Address.<br>
* `2.168.1.77`<br>
* `10.168.1.77`<br>
* `192.168.3.77`<br>
* `192.168.100.77`<br>
